# Image processing configuration

# OpenAI API image processing (preparing images to send to the OpenAI API)
api_image_processing:
  target_dpi: 300  # DPI for rendering/extracting images before API processing.
  grayscale_conversion: true  # Convert color images to grayscale to reduce noise.
  handle_transparency: true  # Flatten images with alpha onto white background.
  # Controls the fidelity of images sent to the OpenAI Responses API.
  # - high: better fidelity OCR, potentially higher token usage
  # - low: faster/cheaper, lower fidelity
  # - auto: omit the parameter and let the model decide
  llm_detail: high

  # JPEG compression quality (1-100) when saving processed images for API use.
  jpeg_quality: 100

  # Resizing behavior prior to sending to the API
  # - auto: choose a resizing strategy based on llm_detail
  # - none: do not resize (only transparency/grayscale steps applied)
  resize_profile: high

  # Parameters for resizing profiles
  # For low detail, cap the longest side to this many pixels (preserve aspect ratio)
  low_max_side_px: 512
  # For high detail, fit into this box (width, height) with padding as needed
  high_target_box: [768, 1536]
